**Introduction**
- 👋 Hi, I’m Alexander Walford.
- 👥 Reach out if you need advice or want to invite me onto your project.
- 📫 Feel free to email me at alexwalford@pm.me and I'll be sure to respond. 
- 🌐 Want to learn more about me? https://alexanderwalford.co.uk
- 📚 Bachelor of Science degree in computing.

**Current Technical Skillset**
- C Languages (C, C#) - Desktop and mobile application development, as well as game development. 
- Web Server Scripting Languages (Django, PHP)
- Website Development (HTML, CSS, JS, React)
- Python (data science, AI ML, and servers)
- Java (application and game development)

I also "know" several other programming languages but have spent limited time working with them, therefore I don't think it's safe to say that they are a part of my professional skillset.
